                                  HASHMAP
(1) find most frequent elements from array?
  Input: {1,3,2,1,4,1}
  Output: 1
(2) check strings are anagram or not ?
  Input: s1 = “listen”    and  s2=”silent”
  Output: true.
(3) check both strings are isomorphic or not ?
 Input: s1=”aab”  and  s2 =”xxy”
 Output: true.
Note:- 
· Each character in the first string maps to exactly one character in the second string.
·  No two characters from the first string map to the same character in the second string.
Eg-  egg" and "add" are isomorphic:
•	'e' maps to 'a', and 'g' maps to 'd'.
