(1) Write code for Fibonacci series using normal logic and recursion?
Input: 
int num = 15;
output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13.
Note:- Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

(2) Write code for finding factorial of a Num ?
Input : 
int num=5;  
output: 120.
Note:- The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

(3) Check number is prime or not if prime then print all it's privious prime nums?
Input: 
int num=17; 
output: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17.
Note:- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1, that can be divided only by 1 and itself.

(4) Write code to check is Armstrong or not ?
Input: 
int num=153; 
output = true.
Note:- An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
       ex- sum of (each digit ^ number of digits) == original number.

(5)Check is number palindrome or not ?
Input: 
int num = 32123;  
output: true.

(7) Count give digits ?
Input: 
int num=12345675;
Output: 8

(8) Reverse digit of numbers ?
Input: 
int num=1234;
Output: 4321

(9) sum of digits for given number?
Input:
int num=1234;
Output: 10

(10) write code for first multiple of 5 and 7 ?
Input :
int num1=5;
int num2=7;
Output: 35

(11) find sum of first n natural number ?
Input: 
int num=3; 
Output: 6

(12) calculate sum of integers until invalid input given invalid input: -1?
        
(13) calculate ‘a’ raise to the power ‘b’ ?
Input:  
int a = 4,   b= 2;
Output: 16

(14) using recursion find nth Fibonacci series?
Input: 
int num=10; 
Output: 55.
